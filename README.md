# Fissiontroid's Metroid Fusion (JP) Autosplitter

## Installation:

* Place the .asl file anywhere on your computer (the LiveSplit folder is a good place)

* (Optional) Open Dbgview.exe

* Open LiveSplit.exe, right click and hit Edit Layout

* Hit + , go to Control and click Scriptable Auto Splitter

* Double-click on it or go to Layout Settings and click the Auto Splitter tab

* Hit Browse then select fusionAutosplitter.asl from wherever you put it

* Hit OK then OK again to close Layout Editor. Open EmuHawk if you haven't already

* (Optional) Check Dbgview.exe to make sure the script is attached to EmuHawk

## New Game Plus Files:

	If starting the run from a New Game Plus file (a file with a Metroid next to it), make sure the NG+

checkbox is checked in the script's settings in LiveSplit's Layout Editor. By default, the script

is set to start from a normal game file.
